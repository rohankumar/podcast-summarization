"'Capitalism has placed a crushing burden on women's shoulders.' In this piece by one of the towering figures of the working-women's movement, Kollontai shows how the old family unit is no longer useful and how communism provides the necessities to lessen the burden of women and we discuss how 100 years later working women are still staggered by the triple load of being a mother, housewife and worker as well as how the capitalist world is still playing catch up to the collossal social changes introduced in the Soviet Union.

"This week's episode of the Spine & Nerve podcast is a very special episode. Dr. Nicolas Karvelas and Dr. Brian Joves had the opportunity to speak with one of the leaders in the field of pain medicine and pain research, Dr. Ricardo Vallejo.  Dr. Vallejo is the co-founder and director of research at Millennium Pain Center in Bloomington, Illinois, and founder and lead investigator of Stimgenics, LLC. They have pioneered a novel spinal cord stimulation (SCS) waveform known as Differential Target Multiplexed (DTM) Spinal Cord Stimulation. Stimgenics‚Äô preclinical research on the neuronal-glial mechanism of action has been recognized at various medical society meetings, receiving six ‚Äúbest of‚Äù awards for their research, three of which were specific to research investigating the DTM mechanism of action. NANS awarded the ‚ÄúBest Basic Science Research Award‚Äù to Stimgenics at their annual meeting in both 2018 and 2019.  In this discussion, the docs dive deep into: - glial cells and their role in chronic pain. - What exactly is DTM? - How is the basic science translating into clinical outcomes? - What do we, as a field/specialty, have to do to continue to progress and change things for our patients?  There were many studies referenced in this discussion, here is a short list of the most relevant literature:  1. Fishman M, Cordner H, Justiz R, et al.

"Former Carolina Panthers offensive lineman and co-host of The Carolina Line Kevin Donnalley joins the One Day Contract crew to discuss ---- SIGH ---- the latest in the Cam Newton saga, whether they think the XFL is going to last and why it is so important to the NFL that it survives, whether the entire roster is on the trading block and if not, which players will be in Carolina next season.¬† Oh, and yes, they're down with OPP. That's other people's processes - whether Matt Rhule and David Tepper are currently working off the right vision, how being on the trade block affects players and whether or not the differing timelines of Rhule and Marty Hurney might cause a problem during the 2020 season. What exactly is a process-based approach and are the Panthers actually using one? That, plus they'll play Cam to Kawann with which players will be on the roster next season - including a surprising flip-flop from Josh & Colin, talk about whether the NFL isn't as tough as it used to be and the moment when Kevin realized that Bruce Irvin was not screwing around.

"In this segment we discuss the 9th Nakshatra, the cunning, secretive, perceptive, powerful sign of Ashlesha. Ashlesha is ruled by the planet Mercury and is represented by the Nagas - or half human/half serpent. Ashlesha posses profound occult abilities and gives the inclination towards astrology, mysticism, and healing.¬†The added element of Mercury gives this nakshatra intelligence, wit, and the addition of the dual potential - poison or medicine? This nakshatra runs from 16¬∞40' - 30¬∞ of Cancer, providing this sign with intuition, vulnerability, and deep, yet sometimes concealed, emotions.

"In this moving and eye-opening episode, the South African Preshika Wright tells us about the support group she created for survivors of abuse. She fondly remembers her grandparents and their work to the community as well as being a teenager during the ending of Apartheid. She opens up about surviving abuse, living with PTSD and having the drive to meet up with other women who had gone through similar circumstances, thus creating the ‚Äúcommunity she was looking for‚Äù. She educates us on victim blaming and its damaging impact for the women who went through abuse, as well as suggesting how to support a loved one who has been through this situation. She shares with us the shocking numbers of domestic violence in Germany and is determined to help reverse this scenario. She is deeply inspired by all the women that, out of extraordinary strength and courage, choose to speak their truth. Above all, she hopes that by sharing her own story, ‚Äúthe value that that brings far outweighs the pain‚Äù that she feels when she speaks about and we can only be thankful for having had the chance to listen to her. ------ ABOUT HER: ‚ÄùPreshika Wright has enjoyed success in a wide ranging career - from an international corporate executive to restaurateur to an energy therapist- but the one where she strives to make the most impact, is with her work for abuse survivors. An abuse survivor herself, Preshika battled PTSD and depression, coming out the other side with a fierce determination to work on healing an often overlooked and misunderstood fact of life for many people - trauma arising from abuse. Her indomitable spirit fuelled her courage to create a community for abuse survivors. The community, which started off as a support group with 6 women in 2018 has now grown to over 50. Preshika describes herself as a fierce force of love, working tirelessly to provide a safe haven to abuse survivors, who don‚Äôt know what to do or where to go or how to start their healing journey. Women receive pro bono support from Preshika, via support group meetings, one-on-one meetings and via phone. Anyone seeking support from this invaluable community of trauma survivors can contact Preshika directly at preshikaw@gmail.com‚Äù "
"This is one of the most remarkable stories ever told!!! In this episode of the Finding Perspective Podcast, Kapil sat down with Vanessa Jass to have her share her story of growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Vanessa details an 18 month period in her life when she was forced in to the world of human trafficking. She breaks down her experience through this very tough time in her life, and what it felt like to have no hope, as well as coping with the death of a dear friend. Vanessa knew deep inside that this was not going to be her future. Her life took a drastic turn for the better when she had escaped the world of human trafficking, and set her mind to going to law school to achieve her dreams of becoming a successful lawyer!¬† "

I sat down with Britt White from the Northern Society for Domestic Peace to talk about the survey they have created to collect information about sexual harassment and misconduct within the tree planting industry. Their initial findings were recently presented at the Western Forestry Contractor‚Äôs Association (WFCA) back in late January. Shortly thereafter a CBC article was released about the findings. We chat first about Britt‚Äôs planting career and go into how she got involved with NSDP, how the survey came about, and what they are hoping to do going forward. We discuss work they are currently doing with some companies in the industry, as well as how the industry is changing as a whole on these issues.

Can Michael Sowers continue his points tear against Rutgers in this in-state rivalry game? Can Penn State merk Cornell at the face-off dot like Ohio State did? If so, they'll win big over the Big Red. If Cornell can half-way handle their f/o business, Jeff Teat and company can keep this game interesting.

"This is March. It‚Äôs a new month and our first episode of the month goes into the Sunday shenanigans at the Honda Classic. We praise the extremely aggressive approach of Sungjae Im that paid off at a PGA National that did not yield many mid-60s rounds. Im continues his climb up the world rankings and will almost certainly be at the Olympics, where he can play his way out of military service. Also from the Honda, we discuss Paul Azinger really twisting the knife on the European Tour and the significance of winning anywhere but the PGA Tour. Mac Hughes‚Äô hard tug left and Tommy Fleetwood‚Äôs balloon ball into the drink provide another referendum and disagreement on protracer. The logic of the Bear Trap name is questioned by Brendan while Andy is apoplectic about someone on TV calling it ‚Äúthe best three-hole stretch in all of golf.‚Äù Ads with an anthropomorphic Cologuard box provide a natural segue into Bernhard Langer‚Äôs win in Tucson.

"EP2: The Addiction of Gamepigeon This podcast is made by the students of Harvard Westlake middle school. Please note that this podcast has nothing to do with Harvard Westlake School and any of its affiliates, and it is neither sponsored nor funded by Harvard Westlake. This episode covers a popular text-messaging app called Gamepigeon which allows users to play two-player games against each other. Our guests, Jack Ryan and Eric Chang will speak about how this is impacting text-messaging today, and if this will continue to be a popular tradition in using your mobile device. Below is a short segment from the episode. ""I am very happy for Gamepigeon‚Äôs existence and think it is a very good business idea. The way it was built has made it popular and regularly-played, and I give lots of credit to the company for making this a trend. Even though I play the same games a lot, taking the bus and texting friends on the weekend has kept me coming back to play more and more. The pros certainly outweigh the cons, and the biggest problem I had was that the game was too addicting, which is actually a good job done by the creators. I would definitely like to continue playing Gamepigeon and hope it continues to be used in the coming years. ¬†"" This podcast is hosted by William Liu, produced by Alden Detmer, Eric Chang, Victor Suh, and Julian Cortez.

"How is the personal information of the more than 1.5 million people who live in strata housing in BC protected? What laws govern the tremendous amount of personal information that is collected, used and disclosed by stratas? What recourse is there for residents who feel their privacy rights have been violated? The latest edition of the PrivacyRight podcast answers these questions and explores some of the most contentious issues relating to privacy in strata housing. These include: how information is handled at strata council meetings; what the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and the Strata Property Act mean in practical terms for people's privacy; and advice for stratas in the social media age. Joining the discussion are Michael McEvoy, Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia; Tony Gioventu, head of the Condominium Homeowners Association of British Columbia, Sandy Wagner, president of the Vancouver Island Strata Owners‚Äô Association and two representatives of property management firm, Cornerstone Properties.

"In this episode, we discuss another difference between investing in small towns and larger cities ‚Äì deferred capital maintenance. Every investor accepts (and hopefully budgets for) the fact that their properties will require maintenance throughout the year. However, we also know that from time to time investment properties will require capital maintenance, especially if the property is older.¬† This could be the replacement of a roof, painting the outside of the property, rewiring the house, or some other major works. These are often not budgeted for and the payment for these works are often made by leveraging the property.¬† But, the cost of this maintenance is more expensive (as a proportion of the house price) for properties in smaller towns than in large cities. That means that a small-town property that appears to be cashflow positive can actually have a poor cashflow once this capital maintenance is factored in. We also mention the Property Investors Quiz, this 7-question quiz will give you a 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe', answer as to whether you are in a position to invest in property right now.¬† "

"Today on Carry the Fire Podcast we are joined by the esteemed professor John Cobb Jr. Dr. Cobb is an American theologian, philosopher, and environmentalist. Cobb is often regarded as the preeminent scholar in the field of process philosophy and process theology. He is also the author of over 30 books and he just celebrated his 95th birthday. He was the first theologian elected to the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his interdisciplinary work in ecology, economics, and biology. While Dr. Cobb is well versed in process philosophy much of his work has been as a process theologian. Process philosophy and theology provide us a means for retaining values such as the good, the true, and the beautiful as well as explaining God‚Äôs agency in the world all without denying what we learn through science. And, often aligning more with what we learn through science vs what we learn through strict materialism. This is a bit of a heady conversation but, John is wise and a delightful human. I believe you will all enjoy this.

By looking at the science of forestry, agroforestry and landscapes through stories, real-life experiences and the lives of people communities around the world, we aim to make that knowledge and information more human, relevant and understandable.

"In the 1980s, protecting the safety of children became a paramount concern. It was the one issue that could unite even the most disparate factions of society, from radical leftists to Christian conservatives.

"In this very special podcast episode I have the absolute honour of interviewing one of my dearest friends, Carol, while she lies in her hospice bed. Carol is dying from stage three ovarian cancer and, yet, even during this personal and private time, wanted to take the opportunity to help others by breaking down some of the stigma and fear around death, dying and end of life care. But don‚Äôt for a second think this episode is sad or depressing. Carol, in typical Northern Irish style will have you laughing and reflecting as she shares her insights into life and love and what really matters most. What makes this episode so special is it is not only rare to get access to this personal insight into end of life care but it rarer still that the interviewer is friends with and dearly loves and cares for the interviewee. However, what makes this episode even more unique is that I am also living with the same disease as Carol and know that, one day, I too will be lying in a hospice bed receiving similar end of life care that she is receiving now. For the past four years Carol and I have developed an unshakable bond through our shared disease as we have supported one another through the highs and lows of living with late stage cancer with tears, laughter and very dark sense of humour. I struggle to imagine a world without her in it and I will be forever grateful to all she has guided and supported me through. I am so grateful to Carol that she has gifted you all this beautiful insight into her life and her death. May her words lift your spirit and guide you on with a heart filled with love. I know that my world will always be brighter because Carol was in it. I love you Carol. Always. "

"This week on the Endure Stronger podcast, we interview double Olympian and European silver medallist Eilish McColgan.¬†¬† Eilish is a Scottish middle distance runner who represented Team GB at the 2012 and the 2016 Olympic Games and is on track to represent Great Britain again this summer in Tokyo. We talk with Eilish about her goals for 2020, her biggest inspiration, overcoming injuries, and how she deals with pre-race nerves - and how you can too. (Eilish is a good person to take advice from about this. She went from competing at the *relatively* small Scottish University championships straight to the London Olympics at the age of twenty.) Eilish also recounts how early in her career, she overcame an injury so bad that one doctor mistook it for a motorcycle accident and told her she wouldn‚Äôt run at an elite level again. We also discuss the troubles females athletes face and the scrutiny in the mainstream media, which lead to a refreshingly honest chat about body shaming.¬† Eilish also tells us about her biggest inspiration - her mum and coach, former world champion Liz McColgan. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting down with Eilish, and there‚Äôs some absolutely golden advice in this episode. ¬†Eilish doesn‚Äôt overcomplicate things. She eats whole food, religiously does her prehab and rehab, and simply aims to run her best every single year.¬† Eilish taught us a a lot, and she has a lot to teach you too.

"As part of our 3-part Radio Juxtapoz special at The Armory Show 2020, we sit down with Philadelphia-based fine artist and teacher, Mark Thomas Gibson. ¬†¬†  We first became aware of Mark's biting and often slyly humorous looks at both contemporary life and American history through a comic book aesthetic, frame-by-frame stories in fine art form. Born in South Florida with a post-graduate degree at Yale (where he was also an instructor before moving to Philly to work at Temple), Gibson's work is so perfectly stated by M+B Gallery: Gibson's painting ""stems from his multipartite viewpoint as an artist‚Äîas a black male, a professor, an American history buff and comic book aficionado."" ¬†¬†  On the occasion of our series at The Armory Show in NYC, Radio Juxtapoz sat down with Mark Thomas Gibson on an early morning before the fair doors opened to talk about his solo booth with M+B, the changing dynamics of not only his work but the overall landscape of contemporary art and how the comic book was his first love. ¬†¬†  The Radio Juxtapoz podcast is hosted by FIFTH WALL TV's Doug Gillen and Juxtapoz editor, Evan Pricco. ¬†¬†Subscribe to the Radio Juxtapoz podcast HERE. ¬†¬†¬†  Episode 038 was recorded live in New York City at Pier 90, March 5, 2020.

"Full show notes for this episode are at https://theanxioustruth.com/98 Telling someone in the grips of a raging anxiety disorder to ""check in with themselves"" is a TERRIBLE bit of advice.¬† If you are in the grips of a ranging anxiety disorder - finding it near impossible to STOP thinking about how you feel all the time - it's OK to reject this advice. While in the grips of raging disorders like OCD, health anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia, specifically making time to focus inward on how one is feeling is like pouring gasoline on a fire.¬† A person that is desperate to STOP paying constant attention to how they feel and what they think does not need to turn inward to see what they need.¬† What they need is to stop focusing inward.¬† The inward focus is driving their problem.¬† Telling this person that they need to check in with themselves to see how they're feeling is like telling an inmate to escape from prison by running back into the cell block.¬† It's just terrible advice in this context.¬† Sorry, but it is. Sometimes part of the anxiety problem is compulsion to think about one's state.¬† Engaging in inner dialogue with fear driven distorted and disordered thoughts becomes a dysfunctional game that the sufferer is powerless to resist.¬† Every waking moment is spend scanning one's own body and mind for threats to sanity, life, and limb.¬† Inward focus and self-examination can become a literal torture chamber. This is a fact for many wrestling with anxiety problems.

"Learned helplessness is a condition where a person suffers from a sense of feeling powerless. It usually comes from a traumatic event or series of traumatic events or persistent failure to succeed. It's one of the biggest underlying causes of depression. When you grow up with abuse and trauma, you learn helplessness, and it becomes an identity for you, its the equivalent to being locked in an emotional prison cell. When you grow up, and you move out on your own, nobody is guarding you, the cell door is not locked, and you can walk out at any time, but you can't do it. You have been conditioned to be helpless. We've become unwilling to walk away from the pain. We accept it as our reality. That's why so many of us get stuck in life and can't move forward. It's like we're in this endless loop, where we sit in pain, and we don't know how to get out of it. It becomes our identity, and it becomes our way of life. We have never known any other way than to completely experience pain and accept that as the reality of our lives. When we realized that the prison doors open, and we can leave, the fear of living without the pain keeps us there because we don't know how to exist without it. We are just stuck. Nobody is guarding us. We are the only person that keeps us from the life that we want and deserve. Your learned helplessness is reversible. It's going to take time, patience, and practice to overcome. The more you venture out of that emotional cell and feel the fear when doing so, the more you are reversing your learned helplessness and teaching yourself that no longer have to be helpless to survive.¬† Website: https://joeryan.com¬†¬† Instagram: https://instagram.com/joeryan  ---   Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/joeryan/message Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/joeryan/support"

"A Perspective on Forgiveness On this episode we are joined by Julie Householder, a life coach and Biofield Immersion Healing Practitioner, to discuss the topic of forgiveness. Most of us believe that forgiveness is an outward act that requires you to be okay with what the other person did to you. We argue that this is just not the case. Forgiveness is an internal shift in awareness and energy within yourself. It‚Äôs the ability to shift the story you tell yourself about the other person, and your relationship to the event. In this episode we discuss:   How forgiveness work is a constant process, not something you do once.  Victim mindset, and how it keeps a lot of us stuck in resentment and an unwillingness to forgive.  How an unwillingness to forgive and hold grudges is actually harming YOU, not the other person.  How taking responsibility for your forgiveness work will increase your sense of agency over your life.   Two life coaches expert tips on how you can begin to forgive even those who have hurt you the most, and why this is so important to your overall health and well-being.

"HR doesn't just need to do digital, it needs to be digital, it simply has to. Put another way, HR must become more digital and analytical to deliver greater business value. This episode is a break from our usual format. It features a panel discussion which took place at the recent People Analytics and Future of Work conference in San Francisco. The discussion was titled HR skills of the future and how to develop them. It features Heather Whiteman, who lectures on people analytics at UC Berkeley, having spent six years previously as Global Head of People Strategy, Analytics, Learning and Operations at GE Digital. RJ Milnor who is the Global Head of People Analytics at Uber and is a previous guest on the show, and Ian Bailie, Managing Director of myHRfuture who previously held various roles at Cisco around Workforce Planning, People Analytics and Talent Acquisition operations, and David Green is the moderator. The topics the panel and David talk about are:   The skills business leaders and CHRO‚Äôs are increasingly needing from their HR professionals  The evolution in learning and how it has been delivered to HR  The ways to help HR professionals feel more comfortable and confident having data-driven conversations  How HR professionals can strike a balance in developing both soft and hard skills  This episode is a must listen for CHRO‚Äôs, Chief Learning Officers, Heads of Organisational Design, those working in a workforce planning or people analytics role, and indeed anyone interested in the skills HR professionals require now and in the future. A huge thank you goes out to Al Adamsen and the team at PAFOW for allowing us to create this podcast from the panel discussion. People Analytics and the Future of Work, which is affectionately known as PAFOW, is a conference taking place in four cities in 2020: San Francisco, Sydney, London on the 29th to 30th of April and New York on the 17th to 18th of November.

"In God's wonderful plan your human IQ can be supplemented by learning God's Word and developing a spiritual IQ. There's a huge difference between human IQ and spiritual IQ. How do you develop a spiritual IQ? Well, it starts with the ten problem-solving devices.¬† Problem-solving device number one is the rebound technique or how to confess your sin and get back in fellowship once you've broken fellowship with God. Once you quench the Holy Spirit and grieve the Holy Spirit by an act of disobedience if you go to the Father in 1 John 1:9 as the Bible says, ‚ÄúIf we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us and even to purify us from all of our wrongdoing.‚Äù¬† We have a battle. The battle is ‚Äúthe flesh wars against the Spirit, the Spirit wars against the flesh; they are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things you'd like to do‚Äù (Galatians 5:17). So when you allow the Holy Spirit to control your sin nature, that‚Äôs what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 5:18, ‚Äúbe filled with the Spirit.‚Äù You are not letting your sin nature control your life if you're filled with the Holy Spirit.

"Today I‚Äôm chatting with autism mom and blogger, Stephanie Hanrahan. Stephanie‚Äôs journey into autism started with her daughter, Campbell. Though Campbell seemed to be developing just fine to everyone else, and was even ahead of the curve, Stephanie sensed there was more going on. She strongly advocated for her daughter and she was diagnosed with ASD at age 3. Later, Stephanie‚Äôs son would also be diagnosed with autism. During all of this, Stephanie‚Äôs husband found out he had a life threatening heart condition and would eventually need a transplant. After her daughter was diagnosed, Stephanie started a private instagram account- it was just for her to document her complicated feelings and grief during this time. Eventually, Stephanie took the brave step to make that account public. Today, she not only has that account but also her blog, ‚ÄòTinkles her Pants‚Äô (best name ever!) where she ‚Äúleaks‚Äù the truth. She shares her journey openly as a way to connect with others.

He says his brain is flooded with negative thoughts that tell him he is not good enough, he can‚Äôt do it, etc. I go over the fundamentals of the process of achieving your purpose once you figure out what it is, and how your purpose will evolve over time as you age and experience it.

It all has to do with something called cryotherapy or cold therapy. This concept is based on hormesis.

When you increase this nerve transmitter, you can: ¬†‚Ä¢ Drop inflammation ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your antioxidant network (including glutathione) ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your mitochondria¬† ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your T-cells  How to take cold showers to get these cold shower benefits: Start out with maybe 30 seconds or a minute, and gradually increase the time you‚Äôre in the cold shower over time.¬†  7 cold shower benefits: 1.

In this episode, we open with poetry, go into Pisces Season magic, mythology (Persephone, Hypnos, the river Lethe in the underworld), explore water and dream magic, ways and reasons to increase intuition, our favorite untranslatable words, and then we decode recurring dreams. This is a delicious, juicy, and star-studded conversation about the importance of liminality and dream state, and the plurality of Pisces. It‚Äôs a DREAMY one.  "

Falls in a hole 
"Make it EIGHT STRAIGHT for the Philadelphia Flyers as they take care of business on their home ice against the Carolina Hurricanes. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals with 87 points, but due to the tie break, the Caps are technicality still in first. Who cares though. The fact that this is even the conversation is beautiful. Carter Hart continues his tear at the Wells Fargo Center and is now 19-2-2 at home with 1.64 goals against average and .942 save percentage. To start off the scoring, Ivan Provorov joins the rush and throws the puck Alex Nedeljkovic, who leaves a juicy rebound for Provorov to put in the net for a 1-0 lead. Scott Laughton and Derek Grant record the assists. In the second period, Laughton, Tyler Pitlick, and Michael Raffl move the puck BEAUTIFULLY through the zones resulting in a 2-0 lead. Justin Williams cracks into the lead in the third due to bad puck-luck for the Flyers. Instantly they respond. That's what makes this team so special. Nate Thompson finds Nicolas Aube-Kubel who throws the biscuit on net from an awkward angle and it finds it's way in! 26 seconds later, Sean Couturier scores from Jakub Voracek and Claude Giroux. That's all she wrote! A 4-1 win and the Flyers will host the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night. "

"Abishek Dutta is currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He is Pursuing a PhD in Environmental Engineering Thesis work in the Water-Energy Nexus, with a main focus on energy and resource recovery from wastewater to make wastewater treatment cyclic in nature. His past experiences include water and wastewater treatment, biofuel industry, microbiology, river restoration and cell biology. At UNLEASH 2019, Abishek worked on an initiative, (called SNKX) to create awareness on untreated wastewater among the public by starting off with education in schools to kids. These kids can act as drivers for change in society by spreading awareness about the problem. The phase 2 is to use an App for direct access to water quality on the coasts. This gives the public access to how clean the beaches are around them. Overall SNKX believes awareness among people will push for change and with this new demand for change there will be political action. https://unleash.org/solutions/s-n-k-x/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekdutta1094/ "

"Running is an aerobic sport. Any athlete who has a previous background in aerobic sports like distance swimming, biking, or soccer will have an aerobic base already established more than someone who was inactive. Speed and endurance are two pieces to the distance running puzzle. Some athletes can crush out a super fast mile time but then struggle with longer distance events like the half marathon or full marathon. Today we will be chatting about training specifically to gain endurance and carry your speed across a longer distance  Are people who have been running or playing sports for longer at an advantage when it comes to training for longer distance running? How long does it typically take to build up to the half marathon distance? How long does it typically take to build up to the full marathon distance? Do you think it may take longer if someone tries to go ‚Äòrace pace‚Äô on their long runs? What if it feels weird to slow down? What are your tips for slowing down on your easy/long runs and not losing your mind? What are the best workouts for someone who is trying to build endurance? What would the ideal athlete week of training look like for someone who is building into a half marathon training cycle How do you know you are training at the right paces? How do you learn how to trust the process? How long does it take to full develop your aerobic abilities? Is mileage building important?  "

"Matthew 17: 1-9 - 'His face shone like the sun.'  CCC Passages: - 554 (in 'A Foretaste of the Kingdom - The Transfiguration') - From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Master ""began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things. . . and be killed, and on the third day be raised."" Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others understand it any better than he. In this context the mysterious episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain, before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John. Jesus' face and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking ""of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem"". A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says: ""This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"" - 444 (in 'The Only Son of God') - The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father designates Jesus his ""beloved Son"". Jesus calls himself the ""only Son of God"", and by this title affirms his eternal pre-existence.  Got a Bible question?

"Matthew 5: 43-48 - 'Pray for those who persecute you.'  CCC Passages: - 1933 (in 'Social Justice') - This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from us. the teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the forgiveness of offenses. He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the New Law, to all enemies. Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy. - 2842 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect""; ""Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful""...It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and the mercy and the love of our God. Only the Spirit by whom we live can make ""ours"" the same mind that was in Christ Jesus (abbreviated) - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 1825 (in 'Hope') - Christ died out of love for us, while we were still ""enemies."" The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to make ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love children and the poor as Christ himself. - 1968 (in 'The New Law') - The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. the Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity. - 2262 (in 'Respect for Human Life') - In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, ""You shall not kill,""and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies (abbreviated) - 1693 (in 'Life in Christ') - Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father,5 and always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father ""who sees in secret,"" in order to become ""perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."" - 2013 (in 'Christian Holiness') - ""All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity."" All are called to holiness: ""Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.""  Got a Bible question?

"Welcome!¬† Waking Life,¬†by Richard Linklater, is a movie that tells the story of a young man who keeps realizing he‚Äôs in¬†a dream, inside of endless other dreams, having philosophical conversations with distinct individuals about the meaning of life, consciousness, the nature of reality, etc. ¬†One of the central questions of the movie is: How can we really know we aren‚Äôt just stuck in a perpetual dream? How can we make sure we are waking? This said, Waking Youth is a bi-weekly podcast that aims to inspire you and me to make sure we aren't sleepwalking through our waking state. Assuming, of course, that the life we consider our waking life isn't merely a dream (but I will hopefully leave such discussion to a whole other episode).

"When most people think of ways you can get high or alter your perception of the world, they immediately think of mind altering drugs. While drugs are certainly effective at doing such things, the human brain hardly needs foreign substances to cross the blood brain barrier in order to see, hear and in general perceive things in a way that is much different from the normal base state of human consciousness. The human mind is incredibly suggestible and can be manipulated in many ways without using drugs at all.  "
"Part of a majesty and grandeur of the American experiment is that no matter who you are or where you come from, with some hard work and determination, you can rise from nothing to become the head of a major criminal organization.

"Do you have a type? Are types even worth having? Turns out, you probably won't marry the same cookie-cutter you've been dating time and time again anyway, so might be time to shake things up. We explore the laws of attraction (turns out, not what we originally thought it was, thank God for search engines) and what it ACTUALLY means to be attracted to someone. Or everyone. MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE:   D.B. Dillard-Wright Ph.D. defines the ""Laws of Attraction"" in Psychology Today.  Guy Redden extends on this theory, the pseudo-science behind it and ""New Thought Philosophy"" in the Journal of Australia.   INSIDER explains the scientific and visual cues that explain why you're attracted to someone.   The Nine Signs You're HANGRY For Love (or just desperate) by Your Tango.   The University of Western Ontario conducted a study into why you won't end up marrying your type.   "
